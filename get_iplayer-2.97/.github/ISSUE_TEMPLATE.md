- You cannot find or download a programme that exists on the iPlayer site
- get_iplayer fails to refresh its programme index cache

If you have in fact stumbled over a bug in get_iplayer, we will tell you in the support forums.

Do not use this issue tracker OR the support forums if:

- get_iplayer does not work outside the UK
- Your VPN, VPS, DNS proxy or HTTP proxy is blocked by the BBC

Any discussion of methods to circumvent BBC geo-blocking is forbidden in both this issue tracker and the support forums. Don't lie about your location. We don't care where you use get_iplayer, but if you are outside the UK, that is almost invariably the reason you are unable to download a programme, so you would be wasting your time and ours by posting a support request. We coudn't help you even if we wanted to.
